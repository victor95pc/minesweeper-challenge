# README

Hi my name is Victor, dear Reviewer ;)

I'll list here some annotations doing this small project.

* The React App is really messy, I would separate them in each file for each render method that I created.

* React app does not have any validations, also something I would do.

* Timer is a library(react-timer).

* The reason why I put flags, bombs and clicked_cell on the same models was to avoid making joins everytime(performace).

* The cell_clicks and the clicked_cell is the same I made a mistake typing them differently.

* revealed_positions, win_game, is_gameover was suppose to be on the database, but I rush them(avoid doing a migration).

* I made this in about 5 hour and half I don't know if this is a problem.
